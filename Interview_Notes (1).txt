What is the Inheritance?

Inheritance is a mechanism by which one object acquires all the properties and behavior of another object of another class.
It is used for Code Reusability and Method Overriding. Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) 
that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class).
Moreover, we can add new methods and fields in your current class also. Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship that is also
known as a parent-child relationship.

                                   class Animal {
        void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class TestOverride {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Cat();
        a.sound();  // Calls overridden method in Cat
    }
}

============================================================================================================
       What is Polymorphism

Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways. 
Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. 
The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms

We can perform polymorphism in Java by method overloading and method overriding.

What is method overloading?
Method overloading is the polymorphism technique that allows us to create multiple methods with the same name but different signatures.
Method overloading in Java occurs when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists (number, type, or order of parameters).

We can achieve method overloading in the following two ways:

Different number of arguments
Different data types of arguments
Method overloading increases the readability of the program. Method overloading is performed to figure out the program quickly.

What is method overloading with type promotion?
By type promotion is method overloading, we mean that one data type can be promoted to another implicitly if no exact matching is found.
sum(int a,long b)
sum(int a,int b,int c)

 obj.sum(20,20);//now second int literal will be promoted to long    
  obj.sum(20,20,20); 
==========================================================================================================
 What is method overriding?
  
   class Vehicle {      
       
     void run() {

     System.out.println("Vehicle is running");

    }      
} 

      
  class Bike extends Vehicle{      
      
    void run() {
     System.out.println("Bike is running safely");
  }     
}  
 
public class Main{   
  public static void main(String args[]){ 
     
  Bike obj = new Bike();  //creating object   
   
  obj.run();  //calling method   
   
  }      
}
  
    

If a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its parent class,
it is known as Method Overriding. Method overriding in Java occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for
a method that is already defined in its superclass. It is used for runtime polymorphism and to implement the interface methods.

Rules for Method Overriding

The method must have the same name as in the parent class.
The method must have the same signature as in the parent class.
Two classes must have an IS-A relationship between them.


//Java Program to demonstrate the real scenario of Java Method Overriding      
//where three classes are overriding the method of a parent class.      

class Bank{      
int getRateOfInterest(){return 0;}      
}      
    
class SBI extends Bank{      
int getRateOfInterest(){return 8;}      
}      
class ICICI extends Bank{      
int getRateOfInterest(){return 7;}      
}      
class AXIS extends Bank{      
int getRateOfInterest(){return 9;}      
}    

==========================================================================================================
   What is Defaault method in java

In Java, a default method is a method in an interface that has a body (implementation). 
It was introduced in Java 8 to allow interfaces to have methods with a default implementation, 
enabling new methods to be added to interfaces without breaking existing classes that implement them.


Key Features:
Default Implementation: A default method allows an interface to provide a basic implementation that can be used by classes implementing the interface.

Optional Override: Classes implementing the interface can choose to override the default method, but it’s not mandatory.

Backward Compatibility: It allows the addition of new methods in interfaces without forcing all implementing classes to modify their code.



public interface Vehicle {  
    // Abstract method
    void start();    

    // Default method
    default void stop() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is stopping...");
    }
}

public class Car implements Vehicle {  
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car is starting...");
    }

    // Using the default implementation of stop() without overriding
}

public class Bike implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Bike is starting...");
    }

    // Overriding the default method
    @Override
    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Bike is stopping in its own way...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle car = new Car();
        car.start();
        car.stop();

        Vehicle bike = new Bike();
        bike.start();
        bike.stop();
    }
}
===============================================================================================

What is the abstraction?
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
It displays just the essential things to the user and hides the internal information,
 
For example, sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. We do not know the internal processing about the message delivery. 
Abstraction enables us to focus on what the object does instead of how it does it. Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of 
how it does it.

In Java, there are two ways to achieve the abstraction.

Abstract Class -- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated (you can’t create objects from it).

                  It is meant to be extended by other classes

                  It can have both abstract (without body) and non-abstract (with body) methods.

                  Can include constructors, fields, and methods with implementation.

                  Used when classes share some common code but also need specific behavior.
Interface
===============================================================================================
      What is Encapsulation in Java
   
Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.
 
 Key Concepts of Encapsulation:
Private variables: Fields (data) are marked as private.

Public getters/setters: Access to those fields is provided through public methods.

Control over data: You can validate, filter, or restrict how values are set.

                                   
                               class Student {
    // Step 1: Private data members
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Step 2: Public getter and setter methods
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        // You can add validation here
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        // Optional: validation logic
        if (age > 0) {
            this.age = age;
        }
    }
}
 
    
    public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s = new Student();
        s.setName("Umesh");
        s.setAge(28);

        System.out.println("Name: " + s.getName());
        System.out.println("Age: " + s.getAge());
    }
}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ConcurrentHashMap


Thread-safe. Allows multiple threads to access and modify the map concurrently without explicit synchronization.

High performance in concurrent environments due to segment-level locking (Java 7) or CAS (Java 8+).

Does not allow null keys or null values.

Uses bucket-level locking or CAS for updates, allowing multiple threads to operate on different buckets

ConcurrentHashMap are fail-safe: they do not throw ConcurrentModificationException and reflect the current state of the map.

Suitable for multi-threaded environments where thread-safe, high-performance map operations are required.


     ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
 
    Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> map.put("A", 1));
    Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> map.put("B", 2));
    t1.start();
    t2.start();
       
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
           HashMap

Not thread-safe. Must be synchronized externally if accessed by multiple threads.

Faster than ConcurrentHashMap in single-threaded or low-contention scenarios because it has no locking.

Allows one null key and multiple null values.

No locking mechanism. Must use Collections.synchronizedMap() or external synchronization for thread safety.

HashMap are fail-fast: they throw ConcurrentModificationException if the map is modified during iteration.

Suitable for single-threaded or low-concurrency applications.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

class Student{

    public String msg;
}

Student s1 = new Student();
s1.msg="Hello";
Student s2 = s1;
s2.msg="World";
System.out.println(s1.msg);
System.out.println(s2.msg);

The msg field of the object that s2 (and s1) points to is updated to "World".
Since s1 and s2 are referring to the same object, this change is reflected for both references.

Lambda Expressions

Lambda Expression basically expresses an instance of the functional interface, in other words, you can say 
it provides a clear and concise way to represent a method of the functional interface using an expression. 
Lambda Expressions are added in Java 8.

@FunctionalInterface ensures that only one abstract method exists in the interface, suitable for lambda expressions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes! A functional interface: @FunctionalInterface

Can have any number of:

Multiple default methods

Multiple  static methods

But only ONE abstract method.

-------------------------------------------

A regular interface (without the annotation):

Can have:

✅ Multiple abstract methods

✅ Multiple default methods

✅ Multiple static methods
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ Example: Lambda without parameter

@FunctionalInterface  
interface Greet {
    void sayHello(); // No parameters
}

public class NoParamLambda {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Greet greet = () -> System.out.println("Hello, Umesh!"); // No parameter in lambda

        greet.sayHello(); // Call the method
    }
}
-------------------------------------------------------
 Single Parameter Lambda Expression

@FunctionalInterface 
interface GreetUser {

    void sayHello(String name);                  // Single parameter method
}

public class SingleParamLambda
 {
    public static void main(String[] args) 
{
        GreetUser greetUser = (name) -> System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");

        greetUser.sayHello("Umesh");
    }
}
-----------------------------------------
Multiple Parameters Lambda Expression

@FunctionalInterface
interface AddNumbers 
{
    int add(int a, int b);               // Two parameter method
}
public class MultiParamLambda 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
   {
        AddNumbers add = (a, b) -> a + b;
        System.out.println("Sum: " + add.add(5, 10));
    }
}
-----------------------------------------------------
Single Parameter Lambda Expression

@FunctionalInterface
interface GreetUser {
    void sayHello(String name);  // Single parameter method
}

public class SingleParamLambda {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GreetUser greetUser = (name) -> System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        greetUser.sayHello("Umesh");
    }
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Functional Interfaces
An interface that contains only one abstract method is known as a functional interface, but there is no restriction,
you can have n number of default and static methods inside a functional interface.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key Benefits of Method References
Improved Readability: Method references simplify the code by removing boilerplate syntax.
Reusability: Existing methods can be directly reused, enhancing modularity.
Functional Programming Support: They work seamlessly with functional interfaces and lambdas.

Method References in Java     : → This is called a colon.

The :: is called a method reference operator.It is used to refer to a method without executing it. 
It acts as a shorthand for lambda expressions.

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class MethodReferenceList {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Umesh", "Rahul", "Amit", "Nisha");

        // Using method reference to iterate and print each name
        names.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
names.forEach(Systems.out::println`);

List<String> names = Arrays.asList("","","","",);
names.forEach(System.out::println);


----------------------------------------------------------
public class Geeks 
{
      // Method
    public static void print(String s) {
        System.out.println(s);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        String[] names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"};

        // Using method reference to print each name
        Arrays.stream(names).forEach(Geeks::print);
    }
}
---------------------------------------------------------
Streams
Stream API is introduced in Java 8 and is used to process collections of objects with the functional style 
of coding using the lambda expression.


import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;

public class GFG {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<Integer> al = new ArrayList<Integer>();

        al.add(2);
        al.add(6);
        al.add(9);
        al.add(4);
        al.add(20);

        System.out.println("Printing the collection : " + al);

        System.out.println();

        List<Integer> ls = al.stream()
                             .filter(i -> i % 2 == 0)
                             .collect(Collectors.toList());

        System.out.println("Printing the List after stream operation : " + ls);
    }
}


Printing the collection : [2, 6, 9, 4, 20]

Printing the List after stream operation : [2, 6, 4, 20]

                                                                      1. Spring Boot Basics
1️⃣ What is Spring Boot, and how is it different from the Spring Framework?

Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring Framework that simplifies Java application development by eliminating boilerplate code and configuration.
Differences:
Feature	       Spring Framework	                                         Spring Boot
Setup	     Requires manual configuration (XML/Java-based)          	Provides auto-configuration
Server	      Requires external servers (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.)	        Comes with embedded servers
Deployment	Generates WAR files for deployment	                Can create standalone JARs
Dependencies	Requires managing dependencies manually	Uses         spring-boot-starter dependencies for simplified setup
Microservices Support	Needs additional setup	                      Designed for microservices

Spring Boot makes it easy to create production-ready applications with minimal effort.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are the advantages of using Spring Boot?
✔ Auto-Configuration – Automatically configures application components based on dependencies.
✔ Standalone Applications – Comes with an embedded server (Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow), so no need for external deployment.
✔ Simplified Dependency Management – Uses spring-boot-starter dependencies to reduce manual configurations.
✔ Microservices-Ready – Ideal for building microservices due to its lightweight nature.
✔ Production-Ready Features – Includes Actuator for monitoring, health checks, and metrics.
✔ Less Boilerplate Code – Reduces the need for XML or complex Java configurations.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the purpose of the @SpringBootApplication annotation?
@SpringBootApplication is a meta-annotation that combines three Spring annotations:

@SpringBootApplication = @Configuration + @EnableAutoConfiguration + @ComponentScan
•	@Configuration – Defines beans in the Spring context.
•	@EnableAutoConfiguration – Automatically configures Spring components based on dependencies.
•	@ComponentScan – Scans for components (@Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller) in the package and sub-packages.

@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the role of spring-boot-starter dependencies?
Spring Boot Starters are pre-defined dependency templates that group commonly used libraries to reduce configuration effort.
Examples of Common Starters:
Starter	Purpose
spring-boot-starter-web	Includes Spring MVC + Embedded Tomcat for web apps
spring-boot-starter-data-jpa	Provides Hibernate + Spring Data JPA
spring-boot-starter-security	Includes Spring Security for authentication/authorization
spring-boot-starter-test	Bundles testing libraries like JUnit, Mockito
spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf	Adds support for Thymeleaf templating engine
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the default embedded server in Spring Boot? Can you change it?
✅ Default Embedded Server: Apache Tomcat (version depends on Spring Boot version).
✅ Can it be changed? Yes! You can replace Tomcat with Jetty or Undertow by excluding spring-boot-starter-tomcat and adding the new server dependency.
Example: Change to Jetty (Maven)
xml
CopyEdit
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jetty</artifactId>
</dependency>
Now, the application will use Jetty instead of Tomcat.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        Dependency Injection & Bean Management
--------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Spring Boot Annotations Explained
What is the difference between @Component, @Service, and @Repository?
All three are Spring stereotypes used to mark classes as Spring-managed beans, but they serve different purposes.

Annotation	Purpose                                            	      Where to Use?

@Component	Generic annotation for any Spring-managed component.	        Any class that needs to be a Spring bean.
@Service	Specialization of @Component, used for business logic.	        Service layer classes.
@Repository	Specialization of @Component, used for data access logic.	DAO (Data Access Objects) interacting with the database.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ Why use @Service and @Repository instead of @Component?
They provide additional features:

@Service – Indicates business logic (can be used with AOP).
@Repository – Provides exception translation for database errors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
7️⃣ What is @RestController, and how is it different from @Controller?

Annotation	Purpose	                             Returns	                       Usage

@Controller	Handles web requests (MVC).	    View (HTML/JSP/Thymeleaf)	Used in traditional web applications.

@RestController	Specialization of @Controller 	    JSON/XML (Response Body)	Used in RESTful web services.
                that simplifies REST API creation.

✅ Example of @Controller (MVC Application)


@Controller
public class PageController {
    @GetMapping("/home")
    public String homePage(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("message", "Welcome to Home Page");
        return "home";  // Returns view (home.jsp or home.html)
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    @GetMapping("/json")
    @ResponseBody
    public String jsonResponse() {
        return "Hello, Umesh!";
    }
=======================================
✅ Example of @RestController (REST API)


@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class ApiController {
    @GetMapping("/users")
    public List<String> getUsers() {
        return List.of("Umesh", "Rahul", "Amit");  // Returns JSON
    }
}
✔ @RestController = @Controller + @ResponseBody
✔ Automatically converts return values to JSON/XML.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
8️⃣ What is the purpose of @Bean annotation in Spring Boot?
What is the use of @Bean annotation in Spring Boot?
@Bean is used to manually define and configure beans in Spring Boot.
Unlike @Component, which automatically detects classes, @Bean is used for third-party classes or when custom initialization is needed.
It is placed inside a @Configuration class.
Example:

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    
    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        return new HikariDataSource();
    }
}
The dataSource() method returns an object that Spring registers as a bean.
Now, this DataSource can be injected anywhere using @Autowired.
Use @Bean when:
✔ You need to configure a bean manually.
✔ You are working with a third-party library.
✔ You want full control over bean creation.
🔹 Difference Between @Bean and @Component

Feature	                   @Bean	                  @Component

Defined in	     @Configuration class	           Directly on the class

When used?	   When you manually create a bean	   When using Spring-managed classes

Third-party support	Yes	                            No
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
9️⃣ What is @ConfigurationProperties, and how is it different from @Value?

Annotation	                     Purpose	                             Scope	                       Example

@Value	                        Injects single property value.	       Single value	                  @Value("${app.name}")


@ConfigurationProperties	Binds whole property groups 	  Multiple values (POJO)	     @ConfigurationProperties(prefix="app")
                                into an object.
---------------------------------------------------
✅ Using @Value (for single values)


@Value("${app.name}")
private String appName;


✅ Using @ConfigurationProperties (for multiple values)
1️⃣ Define properties in application.properties


app.name=TalentShare
app.version=1.0
2️⃣ Bind them to a Java class


@Component
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "app") -- here we use prefix
public class AppProperties {
    private String name;
    private String version;
    
    // Getters and Setters
}
3️⃣ Use the properties in a service


@Autowired
private AppProperties appProperties;


✔ Use @Value for a few values
✔ Use @ConfigurationProperties for structured configuration (better maintainability)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔟 How does @Transactional work in Spring Boot?
@Transactional ensures atomicity by wrapping a method in a transaction.
If a method fails, all database changes inside it rollback automatically.
✅ Example:


@Service
public class UserService {
    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @Transactional
    public void createUser(User user) {
        userRepository.save(user);

        // If an exception occurs, the transaction rolls back
        if (user.getName().isEmpty()) {
            throw new RuntimeException("User name cannot be empty");
        }
    }
}
✔ If user.getName() is empty, the entire transaction is rolled back.

Types of Propagation in @Transactional
Mode	                                    Behavior

REQUIRED (default)	Uses an existing transaction or creates a new one if none exists.

REQUIRES_NEW	Creates a new transaction, suspending any existing one.

MANDATORY	Requires an existing transaction (throws an error if none).

SUPPORTS	Runs within a transaction if one exists, otherwise runs non-transactionally.

NOT_SUPPORTED	Runs without a transaction, suspending any existing transaction.

NEVER	        Throws an error if a transaction is already running.

Conclusion
Use @RestController for APIs and @Controller for web pages.
Use @Bean for manually defining beans, while @Component is for Spring-managed beans.
Use @Value for single values and @ConfigurationProperties for multiple related values.
Use @Transactional to ensure database changes are atomic and rollback-safe.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       3. Dependency Injection & Bean Management

11.   What is dependency injection, and how is it implemented in Spring Boot?

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where dependencies (objects) are provided by the Spring framework instead of 
being manually created using the new keyword.

 DI helps in maintaining loose coupling between classes.

In Spring Boot, DI is implemented using the @Autowired annotation, which automatically injects dependencies where required.


Inversion of Control (IoC) means giving control to the Spring framework to manage
the creation and lifecycle of objects (beans), instead of doing it manually using new.

Example (Constructor Injection - Recommended):

@Component
public class ServiceA {
    public void process() {
        System.out.println("Processing...");
    }
}

@Component
public class Consumer {
    private final ServiceA serviceA;

    @Autowired
    public Consumer(ServiceA serviceA) {
        this.serviceA = serviceA;
    }

    public void execute() {
        serviceA.process();
    }
}
Spring Boot automatically injects ServiceA into Consumer.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1️⃣2️⃣ What are the different bean scopes in Spring Boot?

Spring Boot provides different scopes to manage bean lifecycles:

Singleton (Default) – A single instance is created and shared across the application.
Prototype – A new instance is created every time the bean is requested.
Request – A new instance is created for each HTTP request (only for web applications).
Session – A new instance is created per HTTP session (only for web applications).
Application – A single instance is created for the entire application lifecycle (web apps).
WebSocket – A new instance is created per WebSocket connection.
Example of defining a prototype bean:


@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class PrototypeService {
}
This ensures a new instance is created each time the bean is injected.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1️⃣3️⃣ What is the difference between @Autowired and @Qualifier?

@Autowired: Automatically injects dependencies by type.
@Qualifier: Used when multiple beans of the same type exist, allowing you to specify which bean to inject.

Example of @Autowired:

@Component
public class Car { }

@Component
public class Bike { }

@Component
public class VehicleService {
    private final Car car;

    @Autowired
    public VehicleService(Car car) {
        this.car = car;
    }
}
Example of @Qualifier:

public interface PaymentService {
    void pay();
}

@Service
@Qualifier("creditCardService")
public class CreditCardPaymentService implements PaymentService {
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Paid with credit card");
    }
}

@Service
@Qualifier("paypalService")
public class PaypalPaymentService implements PaymentService {
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Paid with PayPal");
    }
}

@Service
public class PaymentProcessor {

    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("paypalService") // 👈 Spring will inject PaypalPaymentService
    private PaymentService paymentService;

    public void makePayment() {
        paymentService.pay();
    }
}

------------------------

🔥 Without @Qualifier, you'll get:
NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException: expected single matching bean but found 2

==================================================================================
1️⃣4️⃣ How do you define a prototype bean in Spring Boot?

A prototype bean creates a new instance every time it is requested.

To define a prototype bean, use @Component or @Bean with @Scope("prototype").

Example using @Component:


@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class PrototypeBean {
    public PrototypeBean() {
        System.out.println("PrototypeBean instance created");
    }
}
Example using @Bean:


@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    @Scope("prototype")
    public PrototypeBean prototypeBean() {
        return new PrototypeBean();
    }
}
Each injection of PrototypeBean creates a new instance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1️⃣5️⃣ What is the difference between field injection, constructor injection, and setter injection?

Field Injection (Not Recommended)

Uses @Autowired directly on a field.
Not recommended because it makes unit testing harder and does not support immutability.
Example:

@Component
public class Consumer {

    @Autowired
    private ServiceA serviceA;

    public void execute() {
        serviceA.process();
    }
}
Why not recommended?

Cannot be marked as final.
Difficult to test using dependency injection frameworks like Mockito.
Constructor Injection (Recommended)

Injects dependencies via the constructor.  
Recommended because it ensures immutability and simplifies testing.
Example:

@Component
public class Consumer {
    private final ServiceA serviceA;

    @Autowired
    public Consumer(ServiceA serviceA) {
        this.serviceA = serviceA;
    }

    public void execute() {
        serviceA.process();
    }
}
Advantages:

Supports immutability (dependencies are final).
Works well with frameworks like Spring and Mockito for unit testing.
No need for @Autowired starting from Spring 4.3 if there is only one constructor.
Setter Injection (Used for Optional Dependencies)

Injects dependencies using a setter method.
Used when dependencies are optional.
Example:

@Component
public class Consumer {
    private ServiceA serviceA;

    @Autowired
    public void setServiceA(ServiceA serviceA) {
        this.serviceA = serviceA;
    }

    public void execute() {
        serviceA.process();
    }
}
When to use?

When dependency is optional and may change during runtime.
Which one to use?

Use Constructor Injection for mandatory dependencies (Best Practice ✅).
Use Setter Injection for optional dependencies.
Avoid Field Injection unless necessary.
Let me know if you need further clarification! 🚀

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            Spring Boot REST APIs

           1️⃣6️⃣ How do you create a RESTful API using Spring Boot?

To create a RESTful API in Spring Boot:

Use @RestController to define a REST API.

Use @RequestMapping or @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc., for defining endpoints.

Return data as JSON using @ResponseBody (which is included in @RestController).

Example:


@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<String> getUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return ResponseEntity.ok("User with ID: " + id);
    }

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<String> createUser(@RequestBody String userName) {
        return ResponseEntity.ok("User " + userName + " created");
    }
}
@GetMapping("/{id}") handles GET requests.
@PostMapping handles POST requests.
@PathVariable gets URL parameters.
@RequestBody gets JSON request body.
========================================================================================
1️⃣7️⃣ How do you handle exceptions in a Spring Boot REST API?

Spring Boot provides global exception handling using @ExceptionHandler and @ControllerAdvice ,@RestControllerAdvice

Example using @ExceptionHandler in a controller:

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<String> getUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
        if (id < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("ID must be positive");
        }
        return ResponseEntity.ok("User with ID: " + id);
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleIllegalArgument(IllegalArgumentException ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(ex.getMessage());
    }
}
If a user sends id = -1, the API returns 400 Bad Request with an error message.
Using @ControllerAdvice (Global Exception Handling):

@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleIllegalArgument(IllegalArgumentException ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(ex.getMessage());
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleGeneralException(Exception ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).body("Something went wrong");
    }
}
This handles exceptions globally for all controllers.
=====================================================================================================
1️⃣8️⃣ What is the purpose of @RequestBody and @ResponseBody?

@RequestBody is used in a controller to read JSON data from the request body and map it to a Java object.
@ResponseBody is used to convert Java objects into JSON and send them in the HTTP response.
@RestController is a shortcut for @Controller + @ResponseBody, so it automatically converts responses to JSON.

Example using @RequestBody:


@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<String> createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
        return ResponseEntity.ok("User " + user.getName() + " created");
    }
}
The request body JSON will be mapped to a User object.
Example using @ResponseBody:

@Controller
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    @ResponseBody
    public String getUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return "User with ID: " + id;
    }
}
@ResponseBody converts the return value into JSON.
========================================================================================================
1️⃣9️⃣ How do you validate incoming request data in a Spring Boot API?

Spring Boot provides @Valid and @Validated for request validation using Java Bean Validation API (javax.validation).

Steps for validation:

Add validation dependencies in pom.xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
</dependency>

Add validation annotations in the model class.

Example:

import javax.validation.constraints.*;

public class User {

    @NotNull
    private Long id;

    @Size(min = 3, message = "Name must have at least 3 characters")
    private String name;

    @Email(message = "Invalid email format")
    private String email;

    // Getters and Setters
}
Use @Valid in the controller method to trigger validation.

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<String> createUser(@Valid @RequestBody User user) {
        return ResponseEntity.ok("User " + user.getName() + " created");
    }
}
Handle validation errors using @ControllerAdvice.

@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleValidationException(MethodArgumentNotValidException ex) {
        String errorMessage = ex.getBindingResult().getFieldError().getDefaultMessage();
        return ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(errorMessage);
    }
}
If invalid data is provided, it returns 400 Bad Request with a validation message.
=======================================================================================
2️⃣0️⃣ What is @ControllerAdvice, and how is it used?

@ControllerAdvice is a global exception handler for controllers in Spring Boot. It allows centralizing exception handling instead of writing @ExceptionHandler inside each controller.

Example:

@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleResourceNotFound(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).body(ex.getMessage());
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleGeneralException(Exception ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).body("Something went wrong");
    }
}
@ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class) handles ResourceNotFoundException globally.
@ExceptionHandler(Exception.class) handles all other exceptions.
This avoids redundant exception handling code in each controller.

Summary:
Create REST API using @RestController and @RequestMapping.
Handle exceptions using @ExceptionHandler or @ControllerAdvice.
Use @RequestBody to read request JSON, and @ResponseBody to return JSON.
Validate input using @Valid and Bean Validation annotations.
Use @ControllerAdvice for global exception handling.

===================================================================================
✅ Sorting in Java Collections
In Java, sorting collections (like List, Set) can be done using:

🔹 1. Using Collections.sort() (for Lists)

List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Umesh", "Ravi", "Amit");

Collections.sort(names);  // Sorts alphabetically

System.out.println(names); // [Amit, Ravi, Umesh]

➡️ Works on List<T> where T implements Comparable.

🔹 2. Using List.sort() + Lambda / Comparator

List<Integer> nums = Arrays.asList(5, 2, 8, 1);
nums.sort((a, b) -> a - b);  // ascending
System.out.println(nums); // [1, 2, 5, 8]

🔹 3. Sorting Custom Objects Using Comparator

class Employee {
    String name;
    int salary;

    // constructor, getters
    public Employee(String name, int salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return name + " : " + salary;
    }
}

List<Employee> employees = Arrays.asList(
    new Employee("Umesh", 50000),
    new Employee("Amit", 60000),
    new Employee("Ravi", 45000)
);

// Sort by salary
employees.sort(Comparator.comparing(Employee::getSalary));
System.out.println(employees);
➡️ Output:


[Ravi : 45000, Umesh : 50000, Amit : 60000]
🔹 4. Descending Sort

employees.sort(Comparator.comparing(Employee::getSalary).reversed());
🔹 5. Sorting with Multiple Fields

employees.sort(
    Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName)
              .thenComparing(Employee::getSalary)
);
🔹 6. Using Streams

List<Integer> sortedList = nums.stream()
                               .sorted()
                               .collect(Collectors.toList());

===================================================================================

                              Spring Boot Security


5. Spring Boot Security
2️⃣1️⃣ How do you secure a Spring Boot REST API?

To secure a Spring Boot REST API, use Spring Security. Here are some common ways:

Basic Authentication – Uses username and password for authentication.

JWT (JSON Web Token) – Stateless authentication using tokens.

OAuth2 – Uses third-party authorization (Google, GitHub, etc.).

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) – Restrict API access based on user roles.

CORS Configuration – Allow or restrict cross-origin requests.

Basic Authentication Example

1️⃣ Add Spring Security dependency:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
2️⃣ Define security configuration:

@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.csrf().disable()
            .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/api/public").permitAll()
            .antMatchers("/api/private").authenticated()
            .and()
            .httpBasic();
    }
}
/api/public is accessible to everyone.
/api/private requires authentication.
==============================================================================
2️⃣2️⃣ What is JWT (JSON Web Token), and how do you implement it in Spring Boot?

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, self-contained way to securely transmit information as a JSON object. It is commonly used for authentication in REST APIs.

JWT Implementation in Spring Boot
1️⃣ Add JWT dependencies:


<dependency>
    <groupId>io.jsonwebtoken</groupId>
    <artifactId>jjwt</artifactId>
    <version>0.11.5</version>
</dependency>
2️⃣ Create a JWT Utility Class:

import io.jsonwebtoken.*;
import java.util.Date;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import io.jsonwebtoken.security.Keys;

public class JwtUtil {
    private static final SecretKey secretKey = Keys.secretKeyFor(SignatureAlgorithm.HS256);

    public static String generateToken(String username) {
        return Jwts.builder()
                .setSubject(username)
                .setIssuedAt(new Date())
                .setExpiration(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + 86400000)) // 1 day expiry
                .signWith(secretKey)
                .compact();
    }

    public static Claims extractClaims(String token) {
        return Jwts.parserBuilder().setSigningKey(secretKey).build().parseClaimsJws(token).getBody();
    }
}
3️⃣ Secure API with JWT Filter:


@Component
public class JwtFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {

    @Override
    protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        String token = request.getHeader("Authorization");
        if (token != null && token.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
            token = token.substring(7);
            Claims claims = JwtUtil.extractClaims(token);
            System.out.println("Authenticated User: " + claims.getSubject());
        }
        chain.doFilter(request, response);
    }
}
4️⃣ Apply Security Configuration:


@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    private JwtFilter jwtFilter;

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.csrf().disable()
            .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/api/login").permitAll()
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .addFilterBefore(jwtFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
    }
}
User logs in → Server returns JWT token → Client sends JWT in API requests.
=====================================================================================================
2️⃣3️⃣ What is OAuth2, and how does it work with Spring Boot?

OAuth2 is an authorization framework that allows third-party services (Google, Facebook, etc.) to grant access to resources without sharing user credentials.

OAuth2 Authentication Flow
User clicks "Login with Google."
The app redirects to the Google authentication page.
After authentication, Google redirects back with an authorization code.
The app exchanges the code for an access token.
The token is used to access protected resources.
OAuth2 Implementation in Spring Boot
1️⃣ Add dependencies:

xml
Copy
Edit
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
2️⃣ Configure OAuth2 properties in application.yml:


spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        registration:
          google:
            client-id: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
            client-secret: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
            scope: profile, email
3️⃣ Secure API with OAuth2 Login:

java
Copy
Edit
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.oauth2Login()
            .defaultSuccessUrl("/welcome", true);
    }
}
Users can log in via Google OAuth2 instead of username/password.

==========================================================================
2️⃣4️⃣ What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

Authentication verifies who the user is. (Example: Logging in with a username and password).
Authorization determines what the user can access. (Example: Admin users can delete records, but normal users cannot).
Example in Spring Boot

http.authorizeRequests()
    .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
    .antMatchers("/user/**").hasAnyRole("USER", "ADMIN")
    .anyRequest().authenticated();
Only users with ADMIN role can access /admin/**.
Users with USER or ADMIN role can access /user/**.
2️⃣5️⃣ How do you enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in Spring Boot?

CORS allows requests from different domains. By default, Spring Security blocks CORS requests.

Method 1: Enable CORS Globally

@Configuration
public class CorsConfig {

    @Bean
    public WebMvcConfigurer corsConfigurer() {
        return new WebMvcConfigurer() {
            @Override
            public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
                registry.addMapping("/api/**")
                        .allowedOrigins("http://example.com")
                        .allowedMethods("GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE")
                        .allowedHeaders("*");
            }
        };
    }
}
Allows requests from http://example.com to /api/** endpoints.
Method 2: Enable CORS at the Controller Level

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://example.com")
public class ApiController {

    @GetMapping("/data")
    public String getData() {
        return "CORS enabled response";
    }
}
This enables CORS only for this controller.
Method 3: Enable CORS in Security Config
java
Copy
Edit
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.cors().and().csrf().disable()
        .authorizeRequests()
        .anyRequest().authenticated();
}
Important: Ensure cors() is enabled before disabling CSRF.
Summary:
Secure API using Basic Auth, JWT, or OAuth2.
JWT provides stateless authentication using tokens.
OAuth2 allows third-party login (Google, Facebook, etc.).
Authentication checks identity, Authorization checks permissions.
CORS must be enabled for cross-domain requests.

                                Spring Boot Microservices
    
      2️⃣6️⃣ What are microservices, and how does Spring Boot support them?

Microservices is an architecture where an application is divided into small, independent services that communicate via APIs.
Spring Boot supports microservices by providing:
Spring Cloud for distributed systems.
Spring Boot Starter Dependencies for easy setup.
Embedded servers for lightweight deployment.
Resilience tools like Circuit Breakers (Resilience4j).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2️⃣7️⃣ What is Spring Cloud, and how does it help in microservices architecture?

Spring Cloud provides tools to handle common microservices challenges like service discovery, load balancing, configuration management, and fault tolerance.
Key features:
Eureka – Service discovery.
Feign – Simplifies REST communication between services.
Ribbon – Client-side load balancing.
API Gateway – Manages and secures API traffic.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2️⃣8️⃣ What is the role of Eureka Server and Eureka Client in microservices?

Eureka Server acts as a service registry where microservices register themselves.
Eureka Client registers the service with Eureka Server and discovers other services dynamically.
Steps to implement:

Start Eureka Server:

@EnableEurekaServer
@SpringBootApplication
public class EurekaServerApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(EurekaServerApplication.class, args);
    }
}
Register a Eureka Client:

@EnableEurekaClient
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyServiceApplication { }

This allows dynamic service discovery instead of hardcoding URLs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2️⃣9️⃣ What is the difference between client-side and server-side load balancing?

Client-side load balancing: The client decides which instance to call (e.g., Ribbon in Spring Cloud).
Server-side load balancing: A Load Balancer (e.g., Nginx, AWS ALB) distributes traffic among service instances.
Example of Client-Side Load Balancing (Ribbon + Feign)

java
Copy
Edit
@FeignClient(name = "user-service")
public interface UserServiceClient {
    @GetMapping("/users")
    List<User> getUsers();
}
FeignClient fetches a list of available instances from Eureka Server and picks one.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3️⃣0️⃣ What is an API Gateway, and how is it used in microservices?

API Gateway is a single entry point that routes requests to different microservices.
It provides authentication, logging, rate limiting, and load balancing.
Example using Spring Cloud Gateway:


@SpringBootApplication
@EnableDiscoveryClient
public class ApiGatewayApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ApiGatewayApplication.class, args);
    }
}
Configuring routes in application.yml:


spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: user-service
          uri: lb://USER-SERVICE
          predicates:
            - Path=/users/**
Routes /users/** to User-Service dynamically.
=====================================================================================
          Spring Boot Database & Transactions

7. Spring Boot Database & Transactions

3️⃣1️⃣ What is Spring Data JPA, and how is it different from Hibernate?

Spring Data JPA is a high-level abstraction over Hibernate, simplifying database interactions.
Hibernate is a JPA (Java Persistence API) implementation that handles ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
Key differences:
Spring Data JPA provides built-in repository interfaces (e.g., JpaRepository), reducing boilerplate code.
Hibernate requires manual entity management and query execution using SessionFactory.
=========================================================================================
3️⃣2️⃣ How do you configure a Spring Boot application to connect with a MySQL/PostgreSQL database?

1️⃣ Add the required dependencies in pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
=========================================================================================
2️⃣ Configure application.properties or application.yml:

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
Use jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb for PostgreSQL.
==========================================================================================
3️⃣3️⃣ What is the difference between save() and saveAndFlush() in Spring Data JPA?

save() – Saves the entity but delays changes until the transaction is committed.
saveAndFlush() – Saves the entity and immediately flushes changes to the database.
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
User user = new User("John");
userRepository.save(user); // Won't immediately reflect in the database

User anotherUser = new User("Doe");
userRepository.saveAndFlush(anotherUser); // Immediately commits to the database
Use saveAndFlush() when you need changes persisted immediately.
============================================================================
3️⃣4️⃣ What is the role of the EntityManager in Spring Boot?

EntityManager is part of JPA and is used to manage database operations like insert, update, delete, and queries.
It provides low-level access to the persistence context.
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
private EntityManager entityManager;

public void updateUser(Long id, String name) {
    User user = entityManager.find(User.class, id);
    user.setName(name);
    entityManager.merge(user);
}
Unlike JpaRepository, it gives more control over transactions and queries.
===============================================================================
3️⃣5️⃣ How do you handle database transactions in Spring Boot?

Use @Transactional to manage transactions automatically.
If a method fails, changes rollback automatically.
Example:

ja
@Service
public class UserService {
    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @Transactional
    public void createUser(User user) {
        userRepository.save(user);
        if (user.getName().isEmpty()) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Name cannot be empty");
        }
    }
}
If user.getName() is empty, the entire transaction is rolled back.
Transaction Propagation Modes
REQUIRED (Default) – Uses an existing transaction or creates a new one if none exists.
REQUIRES_NEW – Always creates a new transaction, suspending any existing one.
MANDATORY – Throws an exception if no existing transaction is found.
SUPPORTS – Runs within a transaction if one exists, otherwise runs without one.
NOT_SUPPORTED – Runs without a transaction, suspending any existing transaction.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.    Spring Boot Messaging & Event-Driven Architecture

4️⃣1️⃣ What is RabbitMQ/Kafka, and how can you integrate it with Spring Boot?
RabbitMQ and Kafka are messaging brokers used for asynchronous communication between microservices.
RabbitMQ: Uses the AMQP protocol (lightweight, suitable for transactional messaging).
Kafka: Uses a log-based event streaming approach (high throughput, fault-tolerant).
RabbitMQ Integration:
1️⃣ Add dependency:
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-amqp</artifactId>
</dependency>
2️⃣ Producer:


@Autowired
private RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate;

public void sendMessage(String message) {
    rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend("myQueue", message);
}
3️⃣ Consumer:


@RabbitListener(queues = "myQueue")
public void receiveMessage(String message) {
    System.out.println("Received: " + message);
}
Kafka Integration:
1️⃣ Add dependency:


<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.kafka</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-kafka</artifactId>
</dependency>

======================
2️⃣ Producer:

@Autowired
private KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

public void sendMessage(String message) {
    kafkaTemplate.send("myTopic", message);
}
=============
3️⃣ Consumer:


@KafkaListener(topics = "myTopic", groupId = "group_id")
public void listen(String message) {
    System.out.println("Received: " + message);
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------

4️⃣2️⃣ What is the @Async annotation used for in Spring Boot?
@Async makes a method run asynchronously (in a separate thread).
Requires @EnableAsync in a configuration class.
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@EnableAsync
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication { }

@Service
public class AsyncService {
    @Async
    public void process() {
        System.out.println("Executing in thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
Use Case: Non-blocking operations like sending emails, processing images, or calling external APIs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4️⃣3️⃣ How do you implement event-driven communication in Spring Boot?
Use Spring Events (ApplicationEvent) for in-app communication.
Use RabbitMQ/Kafka for cross-service communication.
In-App Event Example:
1️⃣ Define Event:

java
Copy
Edit
public class UserCreatedEvent extends ApplicationEvent {
    private String username;

    public UserCreatedEvent(Object source, String username) {
        super(source);
        this.username = username;
    }

    public String getUsername() {
        return username;
    }
}
2️⃣ Publish Event:


@Autowired
private ApplicationEventPublisher eventPublisher;

public void createUser(String username) {
    eventPublisher.publishEvent(new UserCreatedEvent(this, username));
}
3️⃣ Listen to Event:


@EventListener
public void handleUserCreatedEvent(UserCreatedEvent event) {
    System.out.println("User Created: " + event.getUsername());
}
============================================================================================
Used for decoupling components inside an application.
4️⃣4️⃣ What is @EventListener, and how does it work?
@EventListener listens for application events and executes a method when an event is published.
Example:

java
Copy
Edit
@EventListener
public void handleOrderCreated(OrderCreatedEvent event) {
    System.out.println("Order placed: " + event.getOrderId());
}
This method is triggered automatically when OrderCreatedEvent is published.
================================================================================================
4️⃣5️⃣ How do you handle distributed transactions in a microservices architecture?
1️⃣ Saga Pattern: Breaks transactions into multiple steps. If one step fails, compensating actions undo previous changes.

    What is Saga Pattern?
When one big task (like booking a trip) spans across multiple microservices (flight, hotel, payment), you can't use a regular transaction across all services. Instead, Saga splits the big task into smaller independent operations.

Each operation is:
- A single step handled by one microservice
- Followed by either a next step or a compensating action (undo) if something fails

Example: Booking a Travel Package
Let’s say we want to book a trip:
- Flight Service books a ticket ✅
- Hotel Service reserves a room ✅
- Payment Service charges the user ❌ (Fails)
Since the payment fails, Saga triggers:
- Hotel Service → cancel reservation
- Flight Service → cancel ticket
This way, even though things failed halfway, previous changes are rolled back via compensating steps — no manual cleanup needed!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Choreography – Services communicate directly via events.
Orchestration – A central service manages the transaction.
2️⃣ Eventual Consistency: Instead of strict ACID transactions, use asynchronous events to propagate updates.

3️⃣ Idempotent Operations: Ensure repeated API calls don’t create duplicate records.
                        "Calling the same API multiple times with the same data should not create duplicate records or change the outcome."

                         PUT /users/101
Body:
{
  "phone": "9876543210"
}


- Whether this PUT request is called once or five times, the user's phone number stays the same.
- ✅ No duplicates or inconsistencies.


4️⃣ Outbox Pattern: Store events in a database and publish them only after the transaction is committed.

5️⃣ Two-Phase Commit (2PC): Not recommended due to performance overhead.
========================================================================
More Questions on Messaging & Event-Driven Architecture
4️⃣6️⃣ What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous messaging?
Synchronous: The sender waits for a response (e.g., REST API calls).
Asynchronous: The sender sends a message and doesn’t wait for a response (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
==================================================================================
4️⃣7️⃣ What is the difference between Kafka and RabbitMQ?
RabbitMQ: Message broker with traditional queuing (good for transactional messaging).
Kafka: Event streaming platform with a distributed log (high throughput, used for real-time analytics).
==================================================================================
4️⃣8️⃣ What is a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)?
A queue where failed or unprocessed messages are stored for debugging or retry.
Used in RabbitMQ and Kafka to prevent message loss.
===============================================================================
4️⃣9️⃣ What is idempotency in messaging?
Ensures that a message is processed only once, even if it's delivered multiple times.
Example: Deduplicating messages using a unique transaction ID.
================================================================================
5️⃣0️⃣ What is backpressure in event-driven architecture?
A mechanism to prevent overwhelming consumers by slowing down message production when the system is overloaded.
Kafka handles backpressure automatically using consumer lag monitoring.

==============================================================================================
                       Spring Boot Caching & Performance



3️⃣6️⃣ How do you enable caching in a Spring Boot application?
1️⃣ Add the Spring Boot caching dependency (if not included by default):


<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-cache</artifactId>
</dependency>
2️⃣ Enable caching in the main class:


@EnableCaching
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication { }
3️⃣ Use @Cacheable to cache method results:


@Cacheable("users")
public User getUserById(Long id) {
    return userRepository.findById(id).orElse(null);
}
First call: Fetches data from the database.
Subsequent calls: Fetches data from the cache.


Caching stores frequently used data in memory so future requests can be served faster without hitting the database every time.
When you use @Cacheable("users"):
- On first call, Spring fetches data from the database and stores it in the "users" cache with the method parameter (id) as the key.
- On subsequent calls with the same id, Spring checks the cache first. If the data is found, it returns cached data and skips the repository/database call, improving performance.

@Cacheable("users")
public User getUserById(Long id) {
    return userRepository.findById(id).orElse(null);
}

- id = 101 → DB hit, result stored in cache
- id = 101 (again) → Returned from cache, no DB hit

==============================================================================
3️⃣7️⃣ What are the different cache providers supported by Spring Boot?
Spring Boot supports multiple caching providers:

SimpleCacheManager (Default) – Uses an in-memory map.

Redis – High-performance key-value store.
Caffeine – Java-based caching with time-based eviction.

You can also mention:
- Cache can be in-memory (like using ConcurrentHashMap or Caffeine)
- Or external (Redis, EhCache, Hazelcast)
- Use @CacheEvict to remove outdated entries




Example using Redis Cache:
1️⃣ Add Redis dependency:



<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-redis</artifactId>
</dependency>
2️⃣ Configure application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.cache.type=redis
spring.redis.host=localhost
spring.redis.port=6379
======================================================================
3️⃣8️⃣ How does Spring Boot handle asynchronous processing?

Use @Async to run methods asynchronously in a separate thread.
Requires @EnableAsync in a configuration class.
Example:

@EnableAsync
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication { }

@Service
public class AsyncService {
    @Async
    public void processData() {
        System.out.println("Running in thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
The method runs asynchronously without blocking the main thread.
============================================================================
3️⃣9️⃣ What is the use of @Scheduled annotation in Spring Boot?

@Scheduled is used to run tasks at fixed intervals (e.g., cron jobs, background processing).
Requires @EnableScheduling in a configuration class.
Example:


@EnableScheduling
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication { }

@Component
public class ScheduledTasks {
    
    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 5000) // Runs every 5 seconds
    public void runTask() {
        System.out.println("Executing task...");
    }
}
Other scheduling options:

fixedRate = 5000 → Runs every 5 seconds.
fixedDelay = 5000 → Runs 5 seconds after the previous execution finishes.
cron = "0 0 * * * *" → Runs every hour.
===========================================================================================

Core Java

1. Can we print something on the console without using the main method in Java?

Yes, we can print something on the console without using the main method by using a static block.
Example:


class Test {
    static {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        System.exit(0); // Exit to prevent main method error
    }
}
However, in Java 7 and later, the JVM strictly enforces the presence of the main method,
so this approach may not work reliably.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Can we have multiple static blocks in a Java class?
Yes, a Java class can have multiple static blocks. They are executed in the order in which they appear in the class.
Example:

class Test {
    static {
        System.out.println("Static Block 1");
    }
    static {
        System.out.println("Static Block 2");
    }
}
Output:

Static Block 1  
Static Block 2  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. What is the use of a static block?
A static block is used for initializing static variables or executing code that needs to run once when the class is loaded into memory.

Example:


class Test {
    static int value;
    static {
        value = 10;
        System.out.println("Static Block Executed");
    }
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. What is the finally block in Java?
The finally block in Java is used to execute code after a try-catch block, whether an exception occurs or not.

Example:


try {
    int data = 10 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Exception caught");
} finally {
    System.out.println("This will always execute");
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Can we have multiple finally blocks in Java?
No, a single try block can have only one finally block.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
6. What is the difference between ArrayList and Set?
Feature	         ArrayList	                     Set
Duplicates	Allows duplicates	Does not allow duplicates
Order	Maintains insertion order	Does not guarantee order
Performance	Faster for indexed access	Faster for unique lookups
==================================================================================
7. What is HashMap in Java?
A HashMap is a key-value pair collection in Java where keys are unique. It uses a hashing mechanism for fast access.
Example:

Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("A", 1);
map.put("B", 2);
==========================================================================
What is a Hash Collision in Java?
A hash collision occurs when two different keys or objects generate the same hash code, and hence, 
are mapped to the same bucket in a hash-based data structure like HashMap, HashSet, or Hashtable.


 How Java Maintains/Handles Hash Collisions (HashMap example)
1. Buckets:
HashMap uses an internal array of buckets. Each bucket is a LinkedList or Tree of entries.
==========================================================================
8. Can we use a class as a key in a HashMap? If yes, how?
Yes, we can use a class as a key in HashMap. The class should override equals() and hashCode().

Example:

class Employee {
    int id;
    String name;

    Employee(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return id;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (obj instanceof Employee) {
            return this.id == ((Employee) obj).id;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
===========================================================================
9. What is reflection in Java?
Reflection allows us to inspect and modify classes, methods, and fields at runtime.
Example:


import java.lang.reflect.Method;

public class Demo {
    public void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello from Reflection!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Class<?> clazz = Demo.class;
        Method method = clazz.getMethod("sayHello");
        Object obj = clazz.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();
        method.invoke(obj);  // Outputs: Hello from Reflection!
    }
}
==================================================================================
10. What are functional interfaces in Java?
A functional interface is an interface with exactly one abstract method.

Example:


@FunctionalInterface
interface MyInterface {
    void display();
}
===================================================================================
11. Can a functional interface extend another interface?
Yes, but it should not introduce additional abstract methods.
===========================================================
Java 8 Features
12. What is the difference between filter and map functions in Stream API?
Function	Purpose
filter()	Selects elements based on a condition
map()	Transforms elements
Example:


List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Jack");
names.stream().filter(name -> name.startsWith("J")).forEach(System.out::println);
================================================================================
13. What are terminal and intermediate operations in Stream API?
Intermediate operations (e.g., filter(), map()) return a Stream and are lazy.
Terminal operations (e.g., collect(), forEach()) produce a result or a side effect.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Stream API
When you call .stream(), you get a Stream object — and on a Stream, you can use many functions (methods).


  * Intermediate Operations (lazy — don't execute immediately)
   
        Method	        Purpose                                                             Terminal Operations (trigger execution immediately)
        
        filter()	Filter elements based on condition
 
        map()	        Transform each element

        flatMap()	Flatten nested collections
                                                                                                     Method	Purpose
        sorted()	Sort elements
                                                                                                    collect()	Collect elements into list, set, etc
        distinct()	Remove duplicates                                                           forEach()	Perform action for each element
                                                                                                    count()	Count number of elements
        limit()	        Take only N elements                                                        reduce()	Reduce elements to one (e.g., sum)

        skip()	        Skip first N elements                  

        peek()	        Debugging (see inside the str                                               
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    max()	Find maximum element
                                                                                                    anyMatch()	Returns true if any element matches
                                                                                                    allMatch()	Returns true if all elements match

What is an Index?
An index is like a book index:

Instead of scanning every page, you go directly to the topic with the page number.

Similarly, in SQL:

The database uses the index to go directly to the row instead of scanning every row.
In SQL, an index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval from a table

=========================================================================================================================================
PRIMARY KEY vs UNIQUE KEY

Feature	                Primary Key	                                Unique Key
Purpose	Uniquely        identifies each row in a table	                Ensures uniqueness of the column's values
NULL Allowed?	        ❌ Not allowed (cannot be null)	                ✅ Allowed (but only one null in MySQL)
Number per Table	❗ Only one Primary Key per table 	        ✅ Can have multiple Unique Keys
Enforced Uniqueness?	✅ Yes	                                        ✅ Yes
Creates Index?	        ✅ Automatically creates a clustered index	✅ Creates a non-clustered index
Can be Composite?	✅ Yes (multiple columns)	                ✅ Yes (multiple columns)

=================================================================================================================================================
what is composite key
A composite key is a combination of two or more columns in a table that together uniquely identify a row.

 Definition:
A composite key is used when a single column is not enough to uniquely identify a record.
===================================================================================================================
Foreign Key

A Foreign Key is a column (or a set of columns) in one table that is used to establish a link between the data in two tables. 
It refers to the Primary Key or Unique Key in another table, which creates a relationship between the two tables.



4️⃣0️⃣ How do you improve the performance of a Spring Boot application?
1️⃣ Use Caching – Reduce database calls by caching frequently used data (@Cacheable).
2️⃣ Optimize Database Queries – Use indexes, avoid SELECT *, and optimize JPA queries.
3️⃣ Enable Asynchronous Processing – Use @Async for non-blocking operations.
4️⃣ Use Connection Pooling – Configure HikariCP (Spring Boot default) for efficient DB connections.
5️⃣ Optimize Logging – Use INFO or WARN levels in production instead of DEBUG.
6️⃣ Enable Compression – Use Gzip compression for API responses.
7️⃣ Use Lazy Initialization – Load only required beans on startup (spring.main.lazy-initialization=true).
8️⃣ Optimize Thread Pools – Configure executor pools for async tasks to prevent resource overuse.

1. What is a Circuit Breaker in Microservices?
Answer:
A Circuit Breaker is a design pattern used to detect failures and prevent the system from repeatedly calling a failing service, allowing it time to recover.

When a threshold of failures is reached, the circuit "opens" and further calls are blocked.

After a cool-down period, it enters a "half-open" state to test the downstream service.

2. What are the states of a Circuit Breaker?
Answer:

Closed: Calls flow normally.

Open: Calls are blocked (fallback is used).

Half-Open: Limited calls are allowed to check if the service has recovered.


Explain with a Use Case
“In one of my projects, I integrated Resilience4j with a FeignClient for a loan verification service.
We defined a circuit breaker to avoid retrying when the downstream credit-check system was slow or down. 
This improved system stability and user experienc

Agile Methodology



Agile is a software development approach that focuses on iterative progress, customer collaboration, and adaptability to change. Instead of building the entire product at once, Agile breaks development into small, manageable increments. At the end of each cycle, the team reviews the output, gathers stakeholder feedback, and adjusts the direction if needed. This makes the process more flexible, helps improve product quality, and ensures we're delivering value continuously.”
-----------------------------

Sprint

A sprint is a time interval (usually 2-3 weeks) where a specific amount of work is completed

A Sprint is a short, time-boxed development cycle in Agile—typically 2 to 3 weeks—where the team works on a prioritized set of tasks from the product backlog. The goal is to complete and deliver a working feature by the end of the Sprint. It promotes focused teamwork and ensures regular delivery of increments that stakeholders can test and review.
---------------------------------------

Sprint Planning Meeting

This meeting defines what will be delivered in the upcoming sprint, involving all team members.

A Sprint Planning Meeting is held at the beginning of each Sprint. Its main purpose is to define what work the team will commit to delivering by the end of the Sprint. Everyone involved in the project—the Scrum Master, Product Owner, and development team—participates in this meeting.

---------------------------------------------
PI Planning

Program Increment (PI) Planning is larger than sprint planning, typically spanning a quarter with broader team involvement.
------------------------------------------------------
Daily Stand-up Meeting

A daily meeting to share updates, discuss tasks, and resolve doubts, led by a Scrum Master.


-----------------------------------------------------

Sprint Retrospective

At the end of a sprint, teams discuss what went well and what needs improvement to enhance future sprints.

The Sprint Retrospective is the final ceremony in a Sprint cycle, where the team reflects on how the Sprint went—not just what they delivered, but how they worked together. The goal is to identify successes, challenges, and opportunities for improvement, so the team can continuously evolve and enhance future Sprints.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Story Points                               

A method to estimate the time required for tasks, with points reflecting effort or duration (e.g., a story can equal a day).

Story Points are a unit of measure used in Agile teams to estimate the relative effort required to complete a task or user story. Unlike time-based estimates, Story Points consider factors like complexity, risk, and the amount of work involved. Teams assign point values—say 1, 3, 5, or 8—based on their understanding of the task, often using techniques like Planning Poker to reach consensus

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epic and Spike

An Epic is a large task divided into smaller stories, while a Spike is for uncertain requirements needing research.

Here’s a clear tabular representation of the SOLID principles with Java definitions and Spring Boot examples:

Principle	         Java Definition	Spring Boot Example
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)	A class should have only one reason to change — it should only do one thing.	Separate business logic into a service class and HTTP handling into a controller (e.g., UserService & UserController).
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)	Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.	Use @Component or @Service with interface injection. Add new strategies (e.g., PaymentService: Card, UPI, Wallet) without modifying existing code.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)	Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.	Inject a NotificationService interface, and ensure implementations like EmailService or SMSService behave consistently and don’t break functionality.
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)	Don’t force a class to implement methods it does not use.	Split large interfaces (e.g., UserService) into focused interfaces (UserReadService, UserWriteService) for better separation of concerns.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)	High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Use abstractions.	Define interfaces (e.g., ReportGenerator) and inject them into services using @Autowired. Spring’s IoC container manages the dependency injection.

- Postman for API testing, Swagger for API documentation
- SonarQube for static code analysis
- Compatible with Docker containers for potential cloud deployment

4) What was the architecture of your project ?

1. Understand Requirements
- Clarify the purpose of the API: Who will consume it? What operations should it support?
- Define the core functionalities, data flows, and expected outcomes.
- Example: For a loan API, define endpoints like /apply-loan, /check-status, /upload-docs.

🧪 2. Design the API
- Plan RESTful endpoints using nouns for resources and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Use tools like Swagger/OpenAPI to visualize and document the API contract.
- Decide request/response formats (usually JSON) and standardize error messages.

🔐 3. Set Up Project
- Choose the tech stack: e.g., Java 8 + Spring Boot
- Use Spring Initializr to bootstrap the project structure with dependencies.
- Create modules/packages for controller, service, repository, exception handling, etc.

🧰 4. Develop Core Components
- Controller Layer: Define endpoints and request mappings.
- Service Layer: Write business logic—e.g., eligibility checks, validations.
- Repository Layer: Use JPA or JDBC to connect to MySQL (or any other DB).
- DTOs & Models: Define request/response objects and entity classes.

🔐 5. Add Security & Validation
- Use Spring Security for role-based access, JWT tokens for authentication.
- Validate inputs using annotations like @Valid, @NotNull, @Pattern.

🧪 6. Test Thoroughly
- Use Postman to manually test endpoints.
- Write unit tests using JUnit and integration tests with Mockito or Testcontainers.

📦 7. Document & Refactor
- Annotate APIs with Swagger (@ApiOperation, @ApiResponses, etc.).
- Refactor code for readability and performance using SonarQube insights.

🚀 8. Package & Deploy
- Use Maven to build the project and create artifacts.
- Containerize with Docker if needed.
- Deploy to dev/test environments or cloud (e.g., AWS ECS).
